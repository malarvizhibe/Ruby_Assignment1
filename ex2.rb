# A comment, this is so you can read your program later.
# Anything after the # is ignored by ruby

puts "I could have code like this." # and the comment after is ignored

# You can also use a comment to "disable" or comment out a piece of code:
# puts "This won't run."

puts "This will run."

# Quest 1

# Octothorpe character will make the line disable i.e, If # is used before puts "Hello" , this line will not be executed. Hello won't get printed. We can use # to give comments or disable the particular line of code.

# Quest 2

# Done

# Quest 3 and 4

# I didn't find any mistakes here.
