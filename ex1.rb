# Study drill
# 1. Make your script print another line

puts "Printing 'new' line"

puts "\n"

# 2. Make your script print only one of the lines

#puts "Hello World!"
#puts "Hello Again"
#puts "I like typing this."
#puts "This is fun."
puts "Yah! Printing."
#puts "I'd much rather you 'not'."
#puts 'I "said" do not touch this.'

puts "\n"

# 3. # Octothorpe character will make the line disable i.e, If # is used before puts "Hello" , this line will not be executed. Hello won't get printed. We can use # to give comments or disable the particular line of code.
